# Wave Function Collapse

[![Travis-CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/stevebob/wfc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stevebob/wfc)

Collection of rust libraries implementing the "Wave Function Collapse"
procedural generation algorithm.
 - [wfc](https://github.com/stevebob/wfc/tree/master/wfc): low level crate implementing wfc on arbitrary grids
 - [wfc\_image](https://github.com/stevebob/wfc/tree/master/wfc-image): helper crate simplifying running wfc on image files

Read [this page](https://gridbugs.org/wave-function-collapse/) for a description of how
the Wave Function Collapse algorithm works.
